excerpt: 'This paper targets ISAC-enabled IoV and proposes a resource allocation framework that combines Digital Twins (DT) with Lyapunov-driven deep reinforcement learning. By introducing an innovative instruction-level transmission mode and the Ly-DTMPPO algorithm, it effectively addresses the long-term stability challenge of task offloading in highly dynamic environments. The framework achieves efficient coordination between sensing and communication resources and reduces the system cost by over 40%.'

### **Research Background and Motivation**
With the integration of 6G and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), applications such as autonomous driving impose extremely stringent computational requirements. However, IoV still faces challenges including low spectrum efficiency, difficulty in resource optimization under highly dynamic environments, and poor long-term system stability. In particular, the massive amount of sensor data generated by modern vehicles (over 8 Gbps) places a heavy burden on communication bandwidth.

### **Core Contributions and Innovations**
This paper proposes a **Digital Twin (DT)-assisted resource management framework** that integrates sensing, communication, and computing. The main innovations include:

- **Dual Transmission Modes (DataT & InstrT):** Leveraging the sensing capability of ISAC, in addition to conventional raw data transmission (DataT), an **instruction transmission (InstrT)** mode is introduced. Under this mode, vehicles upload only lightweight computing instructions, and the roadside unit (RSU) reconstructs the task input using sensed data, significantly reducing transmission overhead and latency.

- **Long-Term Stability Modeling (Lyapunov Optimization):** **Lyapunov optimization** is employed to decouple a complex long-term stochastic optimization problem (involving a trade-off between latency and energy consumption) into deterministic per-slot decision-making. This ensures long-term task-queue stability while minimizing the overall system cost.

- **Intelligent Decision Algorithm (Ly-DTMPPO):** A **Lyapunov-driven DT-enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm** is proposed. Operating under the “centralized training and distributed execution” (CTDE) paradigm, the algorithm leverages global state awareness provided by the DT space to enhance decision robustness in high-mobility scenarios.

### **Experimental Results**
Simulation results demonstrate that **Ly-DTMPPO** achieves superior convergence speed and stability. Compared with baseline schemes such as Ly-MADDPG and Ly-MAPPO, it attains up to a **43.9%** improvement in steady-state reward, while significantly reducing the average system latency and energy consumption. It also ensures fast convergence and stability of task queues under dynamic loads.
