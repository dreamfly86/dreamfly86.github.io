title: "Financial Payment Grade Multi-Modal Biometric Devices "
excerpt: "This project used infrared, deep, and visible light multi-modal camera to collect image data and employs a multi-modal
deep learning network with multiple feature branches. To enhance the performance of liveness detection using multi
frame facial image data, an algorithm based on facial texture and behavior features was designed, improving the accuracy 
of continuous frame facial liveness detection. Besides, the related equipment was developed.  <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
