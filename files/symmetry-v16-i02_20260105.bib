ABSTRACT = {In Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communications and computation offloading technology have been introduced to assist with the burdensome sensing task processing, thus prompting a new design paradigm called mobile sensing–communication–computation (MSCC) synergy. Most researchers have focused on offloading strategy design to reduce energy consumption or execution costs, but ignore the intrinsic characteristics of tasks, which may lead to poor performance. This paper studies the offloading strategy of vehicle MSCC tasks represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. According to the DAG dependency of the subtasks, this paper proposes a computation offloading strategy to optimize energy consumption under time constraints. An energy consumption model for task execution is established. Then, the Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search hybrid optimization algorithm (ST-HO) is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the energy consumption. Crucially, this research integrates the concept of symmetry into the typical DAG structure of MSCC tasks, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of task execution in ITS. The simulation results show that ST-HO reduces energy consumption by at least 5.58% compared to the conventional algorithm. Particularly, the convergence speed of ST-HO is improved by 52.63% when the replication strategy of symmetric task is considered.},
